Predicting Work Hours to Hit a Target Production 📈
💼 Story Time
My boss asked me:
“If we want to hit a production volume of 125 units, how many hours should we plan to work this week?”

Instead of guessing, I decided to write a simple 10-line Python script to calculate it for me.
And not just that — I made it so that anyone can reuse it with any pair of independent (X) and dependent (Y) variables.

🛠 What This Script Does
"If we know how past hours affected past production, how many hours will give us a specific production amount?"
We uses simple linear regression to find the relationship between two sets of data:

X: Hours worked per week

Y: Production volume

Then it predicts how many hours you'll need to work to hit a custom production goal.

📦 How It Works (Step by Step)

# 1. Create data of work hours (X) and production volume (Y)
data = {
    'PH(X)' : [34, 35, 39, 42, 43, 47],
    'PV(Y)' : [102, 109, 137, 148, 150, 158]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# 2. Separate the variables
X = df['PH(X)']
y = df['PV(Y)']

# 3. Fit a straight line to the data
np.polyfit(X, y, 1)  # Returns [slope (B1), intercept (b0)]

# 4. Try to predict hours needed for a production target
predict_Hours_For_This_Production_volume = 125
k = (predict_Hours_For_This_Production_volume + 46) / 4.5
🧠 What's Going On
The formula of a straight line is:
Y = B1 * X + b0

np.polyfit gives us B1 (slope) and b0 (intercept).

Normally, to predict the X (hours), you'd rearrange it like:
X = (Y - b0) / B1

But in the code above, a manual estimate is used instead of this formula.

🔧 Customize It
You can:

Replace the data with your own (any X and Y)

Change the target Y value (e.g., 125 → 200)

Calculate X using the proper regression formula
